## Contributing to [rush](https://github.com/rakivo/rush/tree/master)

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `rush`!
We welcome issues, bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests.

## Development Setup

Rush is written in Rust (edition 2021).
To hack on it you’ll need:

- Rust (latest stable recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

Clone the repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/rakivo/rush.git
$ cd rush
```

Build in debug mode:

```console
$ cargo build
```

Run all tests:

```console
cargo test
```

Code Style

- Use `cargo fmt` to format code.
- Use `cargo clippy` to lint before submitting a PR.

Keep unsafe code minimal and documented.

🙌 Thank You

Every contribution — big or small — helps make rush better.
We appreciate your time, effort, and ideas ❤️
